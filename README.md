# About the Project

### Keep in Mind
If you are worried about not being a creative enough person for this *stop right there*. As Sylvia Plath said,```“The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.”``` Don't put an expectation on results, take a deep breath, and have fun with this! If the only thing holding you back is being scared of taking the first step, leap head first. The good news: just like learning to code, the more you are creative, the easier it gets.

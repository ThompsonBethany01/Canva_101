# About the Project
Your Readme.md file is often the first impression someone will make about your repo. Make it a good one by adding visuals to catch their eye and get them excited to dive into your content. Adding a header can set the tone for your project or add emphasis on what you want the audience to read first. You can also use your visuals to portray information in a more digestible manner, such as the layout to your repo files.

### Keep in Mind
If you are worried about not being creative enough for this **stop right there**. As Sylvia Plath said,```‚ÄúThe worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.‚Äù``` Don't put an expectation on results. Instead, take a deep breath and have fun with this! If the only thing holding you back is being scared of taking that first step, leap head first. The good news: just like learning to code, the more you practice unleashing your creativity, the easier it gets.

# *Steps to Creating Awesome Visuals for Your Readme*
![Basic-Steps](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/82/06/e8820672f399daa7297c0cf1c2ac19dc.png)

## Create the Design
<details>
  <summary>Getting Started</summary>
  
  1. Create a free account on Canva.com. You can also sign up for a 1-month free trial of the paid subsrciption.
  2. Click ```Create a design``` in the upper right corner. Choose based on the templates you may want (i.e. resume or business card) or the size you want.
        - if using the free version, you can not resize a design. That's when I recommend choosing based on size.
  3. Check out the templates available. I like to add a page for each template that catches my eye. Then, I choose whichever one I like best or take peices from each.
  5. Add your content, play around with elements or colors, and go with the flow of your *‚ú®imagination‚ú®*.
  6. When you're satisfied with the design, click ```...``` in the top right corner, then ```download```. You can choose which pages and what file type. Another option is to screen shoot the design with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

  <summary>Some Helpful Tips</summary>
  
  ### Elements
  Can't find the element you want?  
  
  - Try adding the image to your design first. Some elements, you can change the color(s) to fit your design better
  - Search what you want with png at the end. If you find something you like, you can copy and paste.
     - For example: ```Github Logo png``` or ```computer cursor gif```
     - You can usually tell if the image has no background if it has a white and grey checkboard background in the search engine
     - You can also use the image effects to remove the background if you have the canva subscription
  - If you need to flip an image, keep in mind you can only crop the image in the original orientation. Crop first, then flip. (It doesn't make sense to me either)
      
  ### Templates
  Templates are very helpful to get you started, whether you have an idea of what you want or need more inspiration.
  
   - Search for templates by idea/theme or by color.
   - When you see one you like, apply to the page. If you see any others you like, add a new page and apply it as well. You don't have to pick just one.
   - Now you can scroll through your options and see the femplates you chose full size. You can settle on one you really like and delete the rest. If you can't decide, add a new blank page and take the pieces you like from different ones to combine how you like.  
   
   Templates are only available on the subscription version. However to me, they make the subscription more than worth it. I suggest signing up for the free trial just to try them out. You can create a header and additional visuals for your github profile reademe and cancel if you feel it isn't for you. 
    
   ### Lock in Place
   If you have an element you want to lock in place, you can do so to keep from accidently moving it around. Simply select the element or multiple elements, and click the lock button in the upper right hand corner. Do the opposite to unlock.

## Upload the Final Product
<details>
  <summary>Via Pinterest</summary>

  1. Create a free account on Pinterest  
  2. Add an image by clicking ```+``` on the bottom right corner of the home page or your profile page   
  3. Choose which image or gif to upload, and add at least a title. Keep your visuals organized by keeping boards (collection of pins) that are helpful for you   
      - ex: one board titled "Git Profile" and other boards based off your repo names  
  4. Go to the pin you created and click on the image. You should be redirected to a new tab that displays only the visual. 
      - The url should end in the file type, such as https://.pin.img/arjhfbajrhbf.png 
  5. Copy and paste this url to reference in the readme file using markdown or html.
  6. Admire the finished product!

  <summary>Other Options</summary>

While Pinterest is the method I prefer, there are certainly other options you can choose based on your own preference. Further reading may be necessary to learn the specifics, as I am not familiar with these.
- Upload images to a repo ! [Optional Text] (../master/myFolder/image.png)
- Open an issue with the image, more [here](https://medium.com/@justynagolawska/how-to-easily-add-screenshots-into-your-readme-file-on-github-d806a01d6ffd)
- Use other third-party websites, more [here](https://www.lifewire.com/free-image-hosting-sites-3486329)

## Adding to Your Readme
<details>
  <summary>Classic Markdown</summary>
  
  Using markdown to reference your visual is very straightforawrd. Now that you have the url to reference, you can plug it into the format of   
  - ```![Image-Description](url)```.   
  
  You can also resize the image if you find the final display to be too big or small. It may take some playing around with. Use  
  - ```![Image-Description](url width=### height=###)```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>HTML Syntax</summary>
  
  ```
  <img src="image_url.png"
     alt="Short Image Description"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" 
     /> 
  ```

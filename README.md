# About the Project
Your Readme.md file is often the first impression someone will make about your repo. Make it a good one by adding visuals to catch their eye and get them excited to dive into your content. Adding a header can set the tone for your project or add emphasis on what you want the audience to read first. You can also use your visuals to portray information in a more digestible manner, such as the layout to your repo files.

### Keep in Mind
If you are worried about not being a creative enough person for this **stop right there**. As Sylvia Plath said,```“The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.”``` Don't put an expectation on results. Instead, take a deep breath and have fun with this! If the only thing holding you back is being scared of taking that first step, leap head first. The good news: just like learning to code, the more you practice unleashing your creativity, the easier it gets.

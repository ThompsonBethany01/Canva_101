# About the Project
Your Readme.md file is often the first impression someone will make about your repo. Make it a good one by adding visuals to catch their eye and get them excited to dive into your content. Adding a header can set the tone for your project or add emphasis on what you want the audience to read first. You can also use your visuals to portray information in a more digestible manner, such as the layout to your repo files.

### Keep in Mind
If you are worried about not being creative enough for this **stop right there**. As Sylvia Plath said,```“The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.”``` Don't put an expectation on results. Instead, take a deep breath and have fun with this! If the only thing holding you back is being scared of taking that first step, leap head first. The good news: just like learning to code, the more you practice unleashing your creativity, the easier it gets.

## Create the Design
<details>
  <summary>Getting Started</summary>
  
  1. Create a free account on Canva.com. You can also sign up for a 1-month free trial of the paid subsrciption.
  2. Click ```Create a design``` in the upper right corner. Choose based on the templates you may want (i.e. resume or business card) or the size you want.
        - if using the free version, you can not resize a design. That's when I recommend choosing based on size.
  3. Check out the templates available. I like to add a page for each template that catches my eye. Then, I choose whichever one I like best or take peices from each.
  5. Add your content, play around with elements or colors, and go with the flow of your *✨imagination✨*.
  6. When you're satisfied with the design, click ```...``` in the top right corner, then ```download```. You can choose which pages and what file type. Another option is to screen shoot the design with <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

## Upload the Final Product
<details>
  <summary>Via Pinterest</summary>

  1. Create a free account on Pinterest  
  2. Add an image by clicking the grey plus button on the bottom right corner of the home page or your profile page   
  3. Choose which image or gif to upload, and add at least a title. Keep your visuals organized by keeping boards (collection of pins) that are helpful for you   
      - ex: one board titled "Git Profile" and other boards based off your repo names  
  4. Go to the pin you created and click on the image. You should be redirected to a new tab that displays only the visual. 
      - The url should end in the file type, such as https://.pin.img/arjhfbajrhbf.png 
  5. Copy and paste this url to reference in the readme file using markdown or html.
  6. Admire the finished product!

  <summary>Other Options</summary>

While Pinterest is the method I prefer, there are certainly other options you can choose based on your own preference. Further reading may be necessary to learn the specifics, as I am not familiar with these.
- Upload images to a repo ! [Optional Text] (../master/myFolder/image.png)
- Open an issue with the image, more [here](https://medium.com/@justynagolawska/how-to-easily-add-screenshots-into-your-readme-file-on-github-d806a01d6ffd)
